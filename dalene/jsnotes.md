        friends = friends + 1;
        friends += 1;
        friends ++;
        ++friends;
        <!--thes do all the same thing -->
    }
    console.log(friends); = 10

    for loop
let friends = 0;
    for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++>) {
        friends++
    }
    console.log(friends); = 10

A function is a bit of re-usable code

  return number + 2;
}
const finalAnswer = addTwo(5);
console.log(finalAnswer); = 7
